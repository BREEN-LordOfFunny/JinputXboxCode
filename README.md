# JinputXboxCode
Repo that contains code for Xbox 360 controller mapping. Ran off of Jinput joystick code, which can be found here: https://theuzo007.wordpress.com/2013/10/26/joystick-in-java-with-jinput-v2/
THE CODE FOUND HERE IS THE ORIGINAL, UNEDITED CODE, PRESERVED IN A STATE FOR ALL TO SEE</h1>
